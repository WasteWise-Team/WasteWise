    A React Native app that utilizes computer vision and navigation to make proper waste disposal easier.
</p>

## Features

### Item Classification
To dispose of an item, users can take a picture of it and receive instructions on how to dispose of it. Then, the app will redirect them to the proper disposal bin (recycling, e-waste, regular garbage).

### Crowdsource Bin
Users can add a new bin to the map by taking a photo. Using computer vision, the app will make sure it's an actual bin before adding it.

The app prevents users from adding bins that already exist.

### User Profile + Customization
In the profile screen, users can see their scan history: a list of the items they have scanned. Users can customize their profile picture, bio, and enable dark/light mode.
